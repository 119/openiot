Service Delivery & Utility Manager Client
=========================================

What is it?
-----------
The Service Delivery & Utility Manager has (as its name indicates) a dual functionality. On the one hand (as a service manager), it is the module enabling data retrieval from the selected sensors comprising the OpenIoT service. On the other hand, the utility manager maintains and retrieves information structures regarding service usage and supports metering, charging and resource management processes. So the role of the SD&UM is to provide means for:
* Executing and delivering the requested services,
* Accessing and processing data streams from the cloud,
* Taking into account processing instructions specified during the request formulation,
* Keeping track of utility parameters associated with the service, for example:
** Time  the service is used,
** Volume of data transmitted,
** Number and type of sensors used,
* Managing and maintaining utility data records.
* Implementing accounting and billing schemes based on the utility data records.
